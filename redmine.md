Redmine is an open-source, flexible project management web application.
Written using Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and
cross-database.

Our instance of the tool lives here: <https://projects.dojo4.com/>.

### We use Redmine for:    

  - project support
  - flexible issue tracking system
  - client communication
  - time tracking

### Redmine use protocols:

  - Except for the most generalized work, if you are working on
    something please make sure it maps back to a ticket in Redmine - if
    one does not exist, please create one
  - Whenever possible, please log time (billable and non-billable) to
    specific tickets
  - Push all communication into Redmine. Any substantive email
    communication shall be added to an existing ticket or turned into a
    new one. Do not allow communication to remain hidden, inaccessible
    and untrackable in email (or other mediums) - promote tranparency,
    trackability and collaboration by exposing that communication in a
    Redmine ticket.
  - Check your board regularly and keep it clean and up-to-date:

### Clients

As much as we try to consolidate our project communication and tracking
to Redmine, we ask clients to do the same. The [Client Redmine
Orientation](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/uQKOXMWTOI1SXtYP) is
