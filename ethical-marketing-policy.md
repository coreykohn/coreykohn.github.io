*At Dojo4 we strive to understand problems before proposing solutions.*

It is rare that we'll work with a client to build what they came in the door asking for. When someone comes to us with a solution, we always push back in order to more comprehensively understand the problem they are trying to solve. We ask why they might have arrived at a particular solution and dig into what other solutions might exist. Our team works to understand the business problem behind a proposed technical solution and the brand and ethos behind a particular set of visual messaging.(See: https://dojo4.com/work/services/product_articulation)


The Dojo4 policy on ethical marketing and consumer engagement is designed to reflect the operating principles of our business:

* Trust - We are committed to showing up as we are - that means that we do not misrepresent ourselves, our accomplishments, skills, experience nor intentions. We take each other at our word and expect the same from our clients. Since trust is the currency we’ve built our business upon, we selectively work with clients who are willing to collaborate to identify genuine solutions, who value the professional opinions of the team they select, and are happy to pay for these services.

* Value - We are devoted to the integrity of the work we produce, at the expense of making money. We are steadfast in recommending what we believe to the best route rather than one that will be most lucrative for Dojo4. 

* Transparency - Radical transparency is baked into the ‘how, why and what’ of all of our work at Dojo4. We are committed to be transparent in our reasoning, language, product and finances. We adhere to the Principles of the Open Source Way (see: https://opensource.com/open-source-way): “Whether we're developing software or solving a business problem, we all have access to the information and materials necessary for doing our best work. And when these materials are accessible, we can build upon each other's ideas and discoveries. We can make more effective decisions and understand how decisions affect us.”


In terms of privacy and representation, as outlined in our written client agreements, we ensure that information disseminated by our company is, to the best of our knowledge, both accurate and factual, and only refers to other persons or organizations in our marketing material if the consent of that person or organization has been obtained.
