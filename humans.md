## Story


```
Dojo4 started, at the end of 2009, as a collective workspace for Boulder developers and designers. The original founders were [Ara Howard]((https://www.instagram.com/drawohara/), [David Clements](https://classic.dojo4.com/friends/dave-clements), [Jeff Larrimore](https://classic.dojo4.com/friends/jeffrey-larrimore) and [Justin Crawford](https://classic.dojo4.com/friends/justin-crawford), all of whom have taken flight in various other beautiful directions. The co-working space quickly morphed into an agency, that employed all the founding co-op members. Over the intervening years we molted and transformed into that B Corp certified member-owned co-operative that we are today.
