# **There is no substitute for genuine human connection and community.**

Technology serves us best as a tool rather than as a directive. As the
human producers of technology, we are committed to:

  - Venerating **nature** as powerful, vulnerable and curative;
  - Respecting users of technology as **living human beings**, each of
    whom wishes and deserves to live a healthy and fulfilled life;
  - Creating **exemplary technology and design** products that aim to
    minimize technological pollution, debt and junk;
  - Building technology that furthers **positive social
    transformation**;
  - **Refraining from causing harm** by releasing shoddy code and
    implementing misguided design;
  - Valuing the importance of genuine, human connection and
    fostering **trusting, rigorous and joyful human relationships** in
    our communities;
  - Using the technology we build as a medium for **treating each other
    and ourselves well**;
  - Having the work we do be informed by **integrity, knowledge and
    humor**;
  - Prioritizing opportunities to do **purposeful work**.
