# **Being a project lead**

> *"A poor leader: the people fear. A good leader: the people love. A
> great leader: the people say, "we did it ourselves."* -Sun Tzu

A project lead exemplifies the Dojo4
[philosophy](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/0OP7nJcwTUENd302) and
[operationalization of our
mission](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/PrDevHsnFoQV5OWF). The following
points should help...

  - Being a lead means that it ships.
  - Being a lead means
    [listening](https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/listen-up/).
  - Being a lead means never letting your ego get in the way of what's
    best for the project and the team.
  - Being a lead means you are constantly aware of the budget.
  - Being a lead means that you have a mental mind-map of the whole damn
    thing. In your sleep. On Sunday. At 10:31 pm.
  - Being a lead means that you plan your weekends and vacations around
    the project. You can hand it off. But you cannot just drop it.
  - Being a lead means that you constantly upsell. At Dojo4 this just
    means looking for shit that needs or should be done, that we can
    excellently do, that the client isn't aware of. Sales at Dojo4 are
    normally just exchanging 'we can do' for 'you need to do' in the
    context of a running project. For Dojo4 sales this should should
    always represent ***acting in the client's best interest*** to see
    *in advance*, what your personal professional capacity allows you to
    see - that the client does not yet see.
  - Being a lead means cutting the hell out of internal waste. You
    should fight, yell, and scream to reduce internal waste. We make
    money by being excellent and shipping code. Look for waste from the
    client's perspective and kill it dead. if you can reduce a project's
    spending from 100k to 10k just do it. They'll be back with other
    awesome projects.
  - Being a lead means that you *aggressively* delegate and recruit when
    you can't do something yourself. You may have to fight for the
    resources you need.
  - Being a lead means that you relish, and encourage, [communication
    with the client](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/uQKOXMWTOI1SXtYP)
    whenever the client feels like it. Or, whenever and however you've
    agreed and patiently trained the client to communicate.
  - Being a lead means that you identify with, care for, and empathize
    with, our clients. Their checks feed our families. And their ideas
    stimulate our own.
  - Being a lead means that, when the shit hits the fan, you are
    responsible for making sure that the shit gets cleaned up and the
    fan is running smoothly.
  - Being a lead means that you put it all into perspective: our
    projects seldom have lives hanging in the balance - you must manage
    your own relationship with the crises, real or perceived, that
    always, always occur in the lifecycles of technology production.
  - Being a lead means setting the tone for the project and providing
    kind, encouraging and consistent leadership to everyone on your
    project team.

Not everyone wants to be a project lead.

Project leads don't want to captain every project they're involved with.

We need all kinds at Dojo4.

If you feel remotely uncomfortable being thrust into a 'lead' role on a
project, or desperately desire that role on another project, talk with
your team and adjust.

Everyone needs to be [clear, comfortable, and capable in their
roles](https://little-startup-handbook.dojo4.com/define-your-roles/).
