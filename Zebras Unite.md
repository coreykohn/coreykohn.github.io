["And they’re in it for the long haul — not just to get their jollies,
make their names, and
exit."](https://medium.com/zebras-unite/sex-startups-53f2f63ded49#.6xc7ss1ew)

This movement acknowledges that [a new startup
ecosystem](https://medium.com/zebras-unite/zebras-lets-get-in-formation-fdcbc72fec4a)
is needed to accommodate and promote companies founded by womxn and
people of color, and this are most often left out of the traditional
funding model.

The founders of Zebras Unite
[say](https://medium.com/zebras-unite/zebrasfix-c467e55f9d96):

> "We believe that developing alternative business models to the startup
> status quo has become a central moral challenge of our time. These
> alternative models will balance profit and purpose, champion
> democracy, and put a premium on sharing power and resources. Companies
> that create a more just and responsible society will hear, help, and
> heal the customers and communities they serve."
