# Development Workflow

## 1\. Create a branch off of `master`

Name the branch with your github name pre-pended:
`copiousfreetime/cool-feature`

## 2\. Writing code

You can link to other pages in your workspace in a couple ways:

  - Type `/link`, press `enter`, and type the name of the page you want.
    This creates a link like this one:
  - To create a link inline, type `@` followed by the title of the page,
    then press `enter`.

## 3\. Create a pull request on Github

Include the Notion task link in your PR description.

## 4\. Submit for review

  - Assign the task in GitHub to the appropriate reviewer.
  - You can always tag a person on a GitHub page by typing `@` followed
    by their name.
