Please track your real time spent on Dojo4 projects everyday. This
includes client and internal projects. 

### Rules of thumb for tracking time:

  - Record your time spent on each project at least daily, if not
    throughout the day.
  - Round up to the nearest quarter or half hour, whatever makes the
    most sense for you.
  - Members (not contractors) should track the time you spend on
    internal projects, as well as client projects.

Log the real hours you spend; do not adjust your hours anticipating some
outcome. Work with dojo4’s business team to handle any disconnect
between hours and value. You may use whatever system you prefer to track
time, but *in order for it to be payable, it must be recorded in*
[*Redmine*](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/i7VMnKMr1bdDY9zb). 

### Here’s how you do it :

  - you can log time on either a specific ticket (generally preferable)
    or on a project
  - if you are logging time on a ticket, you do it from righthand side
    of the ticket view
  - if what you were working on spans specific tickets, you can log it
    on the project in the righthand column of the project overview- you
    can also see details and run reports from here about how much time
    has been spent on the project and each ticket to-date - all time
    logged on tickets and sub projects rolls up into the main project
  - this way you can also easily see what time you (or anyone else) has
    put in on a particular project or over a particular time span by
    running an Overall Spent Time report with any filter you need
  - the same goes for time tracking on dojo4 internal projects or tasks,
    such as meetings - if there is a specific ticket for your work,
    please track your time under that ticket, otherwise track it under
    the general dojo4 project- and as with all projects, please ALWAYS
    include a short description of your work in the comment field

  

### Invoicing Protocol for Contractors

All contractor hours are attached to tickets in
[Redmine](https://dojo4.bit.ai/docs/i7VMnKMr1bdDY9zb). Tracking your
time this way replaces the need for you to invoice dojo4. We simply run
reports for each pay period (the 15th and last day of the month) and pay
you for the hours you have logged since our last pay period. If you find
yourself in urgent need of a payment in between our scheduled dates,
just be in touch with the Operations Manager, directly.

The protocols for billables are:

  - anything you are specifically asked to do for dojo4 is billable -
    i.e. meetings, standups and internal projects - general
    conversations at dojo4 or through dojo4 channels are not.
  - only work assigned to you through a project ticket and general time
    that you are asked to spend on dojo4 activities is billable.
  - if the work assigned to you through project ticket took
    significantly longer than the project lead estimated, please note
    why in Redmine.
  - dojo4 reserves the right not to pay for shoddy or slow work, but
    will always work with contractors to find a fair outcome in
    outstanding circumstances.
