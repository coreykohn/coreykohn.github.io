At Dojo4 we use weekly invoices as a quick turn-around of an accounting
of hours. Sending an accounting of hours **every week**, and having that
kind of visibility and approval, gives us assurance that we're heading
in a direction that our clients feel good about.

How we produce invoices:

  - Dojo4 workers log their hours (both billable & non-billable) in
    [Redmine](./redmine), ideally as
    soon as the work those hours, but by Sunday night at the latest
  - Hours logged in
    [Redmine](./redmine) are sucked
    into our invoicing software,
    [Freshbooks](./biz-tools.md), with an
    integration tool that we built, or manually at
    <https://projects.dojo4.com/freshbooks/time_entries>
  - Invoices are generated manually for each project in
    [Freshbooks](./biz-tools.md) at the
    beginning of every week (or whenever is agreed upon with each
    client)
  - Invoices are based on hours worked but, if needed, are adjusted to
    reflect value
