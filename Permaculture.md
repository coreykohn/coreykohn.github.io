Permaculture permaculture thinking is one of the influences that impact
how and why Dojo4 exists. The [Dojo4
mission](https://dojo4.com/manifesto) references that influence.

The [12 Principles of
Permaculture](https://permacultureprinciples.com/principles/) are
generally applied to agricultural endeavors but are useful in any
cultivation and production projects, such as software development. How
these principles can support generative software production provides
ongoing fuel for contemplation:

1.  Observe and interact
2.  Catch and store energy
3.  Obtain a yield
4.  Apply self-regulation and accept feedback
5.  Use and value renewable resources & services
6.  Produce no waste
7.  Design from patterns to details
8.  Integrate rather than segregate
9.  Use small and slow solutions
10. Use and value diversity
11. Use edges and value the marginal
12. Creatively use and respond to change
