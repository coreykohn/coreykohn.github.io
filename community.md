**Dojo4 is a community masquerading as a business.**

*Since its inception Dojo4 has provided a place for community to gather,
both physically and online. Our offices are open to friends and family
for co-working and have often provided the nexus for social happenings
(did someone say dance party?). Our ethos of radical transparency that
we don't do business behind closed doors and our commitment of work-life
flexibility means that the barriers between our work and the other parts
of our lives are permeable. Friends, children and pets are welcome in
our office not as a perk but as a mainstay of how we do business. We
maintain* [*office rituals*](./office-rituals.md)
*that make it possible to accommodate the concentration needed to do our
work and the interactions we need to be in connection with each other.
This is how we create community.*

## **Community Protocols**

Dojo4 is a community-based, global-scale agency that catalyzes positive
transformations through crafting exemplary technology & design.

Our [mission](https://dojo4.com/manifesto) is to connect rigorous minds
with meaningful work, by changing the way business is done and
cultivating purposeful projects, relationships and environments.

We *operationalize this mission everyday* at Dojo4 *by:*

  - Tending to our relationships. Engaging each other with respect,
    trust, rigor and joy brings value to our company, our professional
    partners and our community.
  - Remembering that our best work happens in an environment of
    integrity, kindness and humor. We don It take ourselves too
    seriously. We talk some smack but we don't denigrate others.
  - Thinking of others. We understand that our actions and behavior
    creates impact.
  - Taking care of ourselves. Listen to your intuition. Move your body.
    Make things with your hands. Unwind your mind. Self-awareness and
    care are pre-requisites for affecting positive change in the world.
