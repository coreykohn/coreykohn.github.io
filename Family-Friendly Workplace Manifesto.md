Whereas being parents or caretakers, having a family, is something that
we should be able to celebrate and have pride in at work, we declare
thisÂ **Family-Friendly Workplace Manifesto**. Having a family provides
joy and challenge. It should not be something that anyone feels the need
to hide, justify, explain away or be embarrassed about.

Parents and other caretakers have the right conditions to be some of our
most valuable co-workers and employees, because:

  - they have no choice but to be used to and conditioned for hard work
    and a relentless schedule
  - they have a lot at stake and are likely to be working not
    necessarily for themselves but for the greater welfare of their
    families
  - their home lives emphasize the need for clear decision-making,
    collaboration and the inescapable need to be able to play well with
    others

Because of this, family-friendly workplaces have the potential to be
more profitable, effective and efficient workplaces. A workplace that
values families, is a happier, more realistic and more sustainable
workplace. It is more likely to retain good employees. It is more likely
to generate good will, a resource that can be drawn on when it is needed
most.

To engender a family-friendly work place, we declare the following...

  - We recognize that life happens. Recurrent sickness, snow days,
    school holidays, child-care fails, school and doctors appointments,
    and emergencies of all kinds are part of the fabric of life and
    cannot be disappeared. The work will get done at another time soon.
  - Having children in the workplace, from time to time, makes it a
    richer place. Small beings may be distracting, but it is good for
    our co-workers to know our families and our families to know our
    coworkers. It provides potential role models for our children. It
    provides potential humor and playfulness for our co-workers. And
    sometimes it is just best, in the big picture, to have our children
    with us rather than the drain on logistical resources that it would
    take to figure out where else they can be.
  - We acknowledge that there is undue burden on single parents,
    financially disadvantaged parents, parents or caretakers of those
    with special needs, breast-feeding mothers and parents of
    sleep-depriving infants. Acknowledging this does not imply a lower
    standard of expectation but allows for the understanding of a
    different set of demands.
  - A healthy family demands a particular kind of schedule. Work and
    meetings scheduled at the last minute or during the time needed to
    get children off to daycare/school or during dinner or bedtime are
    not necessarily going to be doable or productive for parents. A
    workplace that supports flexible schedules and the ability to work
    remotely will optimize and capitalize on the good work that
    parents/caretakers have to offer. We now live in a world that offers
    many tools for productive, asynchronous team work - we will take
    advantage of them to support a healthier, more inclusive and more
    generative workplace.
  - Providing paid parental leave is integral to the structure of a
    family-friendly workplace.
