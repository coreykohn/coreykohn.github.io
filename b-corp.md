[Dojo4 is certified as a B
Corp](https://bcorporation.net/directory/dojo4). We choose this
certification and participation in the B Corp community for a number of
reasons:

  - **Community** - The B Corp community is an impressive cohort of
    inspiring, hardworking and collaborative organizations that we feel
    fortunate to be part of. They've allowed us to be part of a global
    economy of reliable resources for best practices and a valuable
    network for forwarding the success of our business.
  - **Roadmap** - It's easy to want to make a positive impact. But it's
    harder to know how to do that well. The B Corp assessment and
    community have both provided a rich resource for practical know-how
    and inspirational visioning.
  - **Marketing** - We haven't spent a dime on marketing since we became
    a B Corp. Having the certification badge on our website, being able
    to win Best for the World (and Colorado) awards and being able to
    talk with our potential clients about what it means to be a B Corp
    has been all the marketing we need. It frames the conversations we
    want to be having.
  - **Advocacy** - Being a B Corp is one of the ways that we are part of
    the global movement to use business as a force for good. As a
    participant and voice in that movement, we validate that business
    can and should improve peoples' lives and regenerate natural
    environments.
  - **Meaning** - Meaning is the currency that gives our company real
    value. We are in a constant cycle of forgetting the purpose of our
    business, losing heart and then being reminded once again. Being a B
    Corp has provided us with a safety net to help us from falling off
    that cycle of finding meaning. The principles of interdependence,
    symbolized by B Corps, give us the fundamental purpose of being of
    benefit, that we to come back to over and over again.
